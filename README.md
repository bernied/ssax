To be clear: I have nothing to do with this software, other then I am a fan. I meerly copied their code from SourceForge to github.

S-exp-based XML parsing/query/conversion
========================================

This project offers tools to inter-convert between an angular-bracket and a more efficient S-expression-based notations for markup documents, and to manipulate and query XML data in Scheme. The main components of the project are **SSAX**, **SXML**, **SXPath**, and **SXSLT**.

A SSAX functional XML parsing framework consists of a DOM/SXML parser, a SAX parser, and a supporting library of lexing and parsing procedures. The procedures in the package can be used separately to tokenize or parse various pieces of XML documents. The framework supports XML Namespaces, character, internal and external parsed entities, attribute value normalization, processing instructions and CDATA sections. The package includes a semi-validating *SXML parser:* a DOM-mode parser that is an instantiation of a SAX parser (called **SSAX**).

**SSAX** is a full-featured, algorithmically optimal, pure-functional parser, which can act as a stream processor. **SSAX** is an efficient SAX parser that is *easy to use*. **SSAX** minimizes the amount of application-specific state that has to be shared among user-supplied event handlers. **SSAX** makes the maintenance of an application-specific element stack unnecessary, which eliminates several classes of common bugs. **SSAX** is written in a pure-functional subset of Scheme. Therefore, the event handlers are referentially transparent, which makes them easier for a programmer to write and to reason about. The more expressive, reliable and easier to use application interface for the event-driven XML parsing is the outcome of implementing the parsing engine as an enhanced tree fold combinator, which fully captures the control pattern of the depth-first tree traversal.

**SXML** is an abstract syntax tree of an XML document. **SXML** is also a concrete representation of the XML Infoset in the form of S-expressions.

**SXSLT** is a manipulation language for XML and **SXPath** is an XPath-conforming XML query language. Both languages internally rely on **SXML** as a representation of the XML Infoset.

[Advanced SXLST tutorial](http://okmij.org/ftp/Scheme/sxslt-advanced.scm)<br>
This file describes common patterns of SXSLT on an interesting example. We demonstrate higher-order tags, pre-order and post-order transformations, re-writing of SXML elements in regular and special ways, context-sensitive applications of re-writing rules, and reflection. Although the file is technically a Scheme source code, it is actually a tutorial. Of 357 lines in the file, 241 are comments and 24 are just blank lines. August 2003.

[SXSLT: Manipulation Language for XML](http://okmij.org/ftp/papers/SXSLT-talk.pdf)<br>
A transcript of a presentation at PADL 2003. The talk introduces SXSLT and compares it with XSLT. Our experience and user comments show that SXSLT is expressive and easy to use. We argue that this outcome is a consequence of SXSLT providing right abstractions for XML transformations, of being higher-order, declarative and extensible.
