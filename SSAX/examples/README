       Examples and the sample code of SSAX parsing and SXML transformations

Remove-tags example 
-------------------

Given an XML document, remove all the markup and print the resulting document.
This is a simple in-out application.

    $ make run-remove-markup-bigloo
    $ ./run-remove-markup-bigloo xml/ddn.rdf

See the files remove-markup.scm and remove-markup.scm.

The Makefile includes targets that run the above example under a few other
Scheme compilers/interpreters.


Outline example
--------------- 

Pretty-print the structure of an XML document (disregarding the
character data)
This example corresponds to outline.c of the Expat distribution.
The example demonstrates how to transform an XML document on the
fly, as we parse it.

    $ make run-outline-bigloo
    $ ./run-outline-bigloo xml/total_weather.xsl

Note that the tags of elements with no XML namespace are printed as
they are. Tags of elements within an XML namespace are printed as a
pair (Namespace-URI . Local-name)

See the files outline.scm and run-outline.scm.

The Makefile includes targets that run the above example under a few other
Scheme compilers/interpreters.


SXML example
------------
Transform an XML document into SXML. See ../docs/SXML.html for
the description.

    $ make run-sxml-bigloo
    $ ./run-sxml-bigloo xml/OMF-sample.xml

See the file run-sxml.scm.

The Makefile includes targets that run the above example under a few other
Scheme compilers/interpreters.
