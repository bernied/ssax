;****************************************************************************
;			Simple Parsing of input
;
; The following simple functions surprisingly often suffice to parse
; an input stream. They either skip, or build and return tokens,
; according to inclusion or delimiting semantics. The list of
; characters to expect, include, or to break at may vary from one
; invocation of a function to another. This allows the functions to
; easily parse even context-sensitive languages.
;
; EOF is generally frowned on, and thrown up upon if encountered.
; Exceptions are mentioned specifically. The list of expected characters 
; (characters to skip until, or break-characters) may include an EOF
; "character", which is to be coded as symbol *eof*
;
; The input stream to parse is specified as a PORT, which is usually
; the last (and optional) argument. It defaults to the current input
; port if omitted.
;
; IMPORT
; This package relies on a function parser-error, which must be defined
; by a user of the package. The function has the following signature:
;	parser-error PORT MESSAGE SPECIALISING-MSG*
; Many procedures of this package call parser-error to report a parsing
; error.  The first argument is a port, which typically points to the
; offending character or its neighborhood. Most of the Scheme systems
; let the user query a PORT for the current position. MESSAGE is the
; description of the error. Other arguments supply more details about
; the problem.

; That policy is good only when a Scheme system is multi-threaded with
; preemptive scheduling, or when a Scheme system supports shared substrings.
; In all the other cases, it's better for input-parse:init-buffer to
; return the same static buffer. next-token* functions return a copy
; (a substring) of accumulated data, so the same buffer can be reused.
; We shouldn't worry about new token being too large: next-token will use
; a larger buffer automatically. Still, the best size for the static buffer
; is to allow most of the tokens to fit in.
; Using a static buffer _dramatically_ reduces the amount of produced garbage
; (e.g., during XML parsing).
