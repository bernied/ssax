 *			substring->symbol
 *
 * Converting a substring to a Scheme symbol
 *
 * This C code implements a function substring->symbol:
 *	substring->symbol STR BEG END
 * which converts a substring of STR to a symbol. The function can be
 * defined as
 *      (define (substring->symbol STR BEG END)
 *	    (string->symbol (substring STR BEG END)))
 * However, the current C version is faster and produces no garbage
 * in case the resulting symbol has already been seen. This function
 * can be regarded as a "shared substring" implementation of the
 * above code.
 *
 * To use this efficient version in your Scheme code, you have to add
 * (extern (substring->symbol::symbol (::string ::int ::int)    
 *		"substring_to_symbol")
 *	   (include "substring-symbol.c"))
 * (pragma
 * 	   (substring->symbol no-cfa-top nesting))
 * to your module declaration. Note the 'include' clause will insert this
 * file into the C code generated by the Bigloo compiler. Therefore,
 * you should not compile this file separately.
 *
 * This code is specific to the Bigloo Scheme system by Manuel Serrano.
 *
 * The code is almost entirely based on a function 'string_to_symbol'
 * in bigloo2.4b/runtime/Clib/csymbol.c of Bigloo distribution.
