		Benchmarks of the SSAX parser

String-value benchmark
----------------------

This benchmark compares the performance of SSAX and Expat in
"untagging" an XML document representing a full binary tree

See SSAX-benchmark-1.txt for more details about the benchmark
and for the discussion of its results.

This benchmark requires Expat, which you can obtain from, for
example, expat.sourceforge.net

You may need to adjust the Makefile to account for location of
the Expat library and and the Scheme compiler on your system.
The Makefile as it is written assumes a Bigloo Scheme system and the Expat,
in the "standard" locations (under /usr/local).

	$ make bench1

will make the test files, make benchmark applications and run them.
