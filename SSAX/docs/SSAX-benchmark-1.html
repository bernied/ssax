<p>We present the results of a benchmark that compares the
performance of C and Scheme XML parsers. The benchmark gives an
insight in the performance of Scheme, compared to the best C
code. We also discuss differences between SSAX and Expat in terms
of features and the user interface.</p>
<p>This page is a compilation of two articles posted on 
a newsgroup comp.lang.scheme On Nov 1 and 5, 2001, extended with
answers to common comments.</p>
<br>&nbsp;<a name="Introduction to the benchmark">&nbsp;</a>
<h2>Introduction to the benchmark</h2>
<p>The benchmark is &quot;untagging&quot; of an XML document realizing a full
binary tree, such as</p>
<pre>     &lt;node&gt;&lt;node&gt;&lt;node&gt;&lt;node&gt;&lt;leaf&gt;0&lt;/leaf&gt;&lt;leaf&gt;1&lt;/leaf&gt;&lt;/node&gt;
                       &lt;node&gt;&lt;leaf&gt;2&lt;/leaf&gt;&lt;leaf&gt;3&lt;/leaf&gt;&lt;/node&gt;&lt;/node&gt;
                 &lt;node&gt;&lt;node&gt;&lt;leaf&gt;4&lt;/leaf&gt;&lt;leaf&gt;5&lt;/leaf&gt;&lt;/node&gt;
                       &lt;node&gt;&lt;leaf&gt;6&lt;/leaf&gt;&lt;leaf&gt;7&lt;/leaf&gt;&lt;/node&gt;&lt;/node&gt;&lt;/node&gt;
           &lt;node&gt;&lt;node&gt;&lt;node&gt;&lt;leaf&gt;8&lt;/leaf&gt;&lt;leaf&gt;9&lt;/leaf&gt;&lt;/node&gt;
                       &lt;node&gt;&lt;leaf&gt;0&lt;/leaf&gt;&lt;leaf&gt;1&lt;/leaf&gt;&lt;/node&gt;&lt;/node&gt;
     	      &lt;node&gt;&lt;node&gt;&lt;leaf&gt;2&lt;/leaf&gt;&lt;leaf&gt;3&lt;/leaf&gt;&lt;/node&gt;
                       &lt;node&gt;&lt;leaf&gt;4&lt;/leaf&gt;&lt;leaf&gt;5&lt;/leaf&gt;&lt;/node&gt;&lt;/node&gt;
     &lt;/node&gt;&lt;/node&gt;
</pre>The content of leaf nodes is a single-digit string. In loftier terms,
we compute a <code>string-value</code>
 of the document root.<br>&nbsp;<a name="Expat and SSAX">&nbsp;</a>
<h2>Expat and SSAX</h2>
<p>To make the comparison meaningful, we need to discuss input models of
Expat and SSAX.</p>
<p>Expat is <em>the</em>
 fastest XML parser [<a href="#Expat-tutorial">Expat-tutorial</a>]. It is written in C by James
Clark. It is a SAX parser. An application that uses Expat must open an
XML file or stream and read its blocks into memory. The application
should pass these blocks to Expat, indicating the block size and if it
is the last block of the document. An application can potentially load
the whole document into memory and pass this single block to
Expat. The parser is specifically optimized for such a scenario, because
Expat uses shared substrings as much as possible. The first benchmark
application, 'string-value.c', reads the whole document into memory,
passes it to Expat and asks the parser to compute the string value. It
takes 0.105 sec user time for string-value.c to handle an XML document
that represents a full binary tree of depth 15 (32768 leaf nodes,
total size 884,723 bytes). This is indeed fast.</p>
<p>The Expat input mode assumes that a calling application must know when
the document ends. Otherwise, an application cannot read the document
from a stream, in whole or in blocks. When the document to parse is
read from a regular file, it is trivial to find out when we are
finished reading. The OS will tell us. However, if we take a document
from a (tcp) pipe, it may be impossible to tell offhand when to stop
reading. Furthermore, if we unwittingly try to read one extra
character, we become blocked and possibly deadlocked.</p>
<p>SSAX is also a SAX parser [<a href="#SSAX">SSAX</a>]. It is written completely in
Scheme. SSAX uses a different input model. Rather than relying on an
application to feed data to it, SSAX reads characters from a given
input port itself.  SSAX reads ahead by no more than one character,
and only when the parser is positive the character to read ahead must be
available. SSAX does not need to be told when the document is
ended. On the contrary, SSAX will tell you when it has finished
parsing a root (or other) element. SSAX therefore is safe to be used
on pipes, to process several documents in a file, or to handle
selected parts of a document.</p>
<p>Therefore, to meaningfully compare SSAX with Expat, we need to modify
the Expat application. string-value-by-one.c is such a modified
benchmark.  It loads an XML document into memory first. It then passes
the content of that buffer one character at a time to Expat. This
simulates the work of the SSAX parser. It takes 0.747 user seconds for
string-value-by-one.c to handle the same XML document as above (full
binary tree of depth 15).</p>
<p>A SSAX benchmark string-value-ssax.scm likewise loads an XML document
first, opens the memory buffer as a string port and passes the port to
SSAX. It takes 1.092 user seconds to handle the same
document. string-value-ssax.scm was compiled by Bigloo 2.4a.</p>
<p>The complete code for the benchmark is part of the SSAX project at SourceForge [<a href="#SSAX-benchmarks">SSAX-benchmarks</a>]</p>

<p>You can trust the precision of the timings: they were reported by
 <code>getrusage()</code>
, using a microsecond virtual clock. All
benchmarks were run on a FreeBSD 4.0-RELEASE system, Pentium III Xeon
500 MHz. The numbers above reflect activities that occur entirely in
memory. There is no i/o whatsoever -- neither application i/o nor
VM-related i/o. There were no page faults.</p>
<p>The most striking result is that a Scheme application is only 1.4
times slower than a comparable well-written C application. <strong>Only
1.4 times!</strong>
 Note Java applications are generally far slower than
comparable C applications. Some XML performance benchmarks [<a href="#Parser-benchmark">Parser-benchmark</a>] show that even the fastest Java XML parser (XP) is slower than Expat
by an order of magnitude; Perl and Python parsers that are based on
Expat [sic!] are slower than Expat by a factor of 20-25 (for large
files). Thus the SSAX parser seems quite competitive in
performance. Again, many thanks to Manuel Serrano for his excellent optimizing
compiler, Bigloo. BTW, did I mention that SSAX is a pure functional parser?
The whole parser and all of its handlers are completely referentially
transparent.</p>
<br>&nbsp;<a name="Why SSAX?">&nbsp;</a>
<h2>Why SSAX?</h2>
<p>Despite some similarities between SSAX and Expat (which came as
a surprise to me myself), SSAX is <em>not</em>
 a Scheme clone of
Expat. SSAX is intended to be a toolkit for various markup-related
tasks. One example -- parsing of (potentially invalid) HTML -- has
been demonstrated recently [<a href="#HTML-parsing">HTML-parsing</a>]. I was surprised
myself at how easy it was to write an HTML parser/lexer using
SSAX. The major difference between SSAX and Expat however is that SSAX
has a better interface.</p>
<br>&nbsp;<a name="SSAX has a better API">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>SSAX has a better API</h3>
<p>The application interface of SSAX has several advantages over
Expat API. SSAX minimizes the amount of application-specific state
that has to be shared among user-supplied event handlers. In
particular, SSAX makes the maintenance of an element stack
unnecessary, which eliminates several classes of common bugs. SSAX is
written in a pure-functional subset of Scheme. Therefore, the event
handlers are referentially transparent, which makes them easier for a
programmer to write and to reason about. The more expressive, reliable
and easier to use application interface for the event-driven XML
parsing is the outcome of implementing the parsing engine as an
enhanced tree fold combinator, which fully captures the control
pattern of the depth-first tree traversal.</p>
<p>A tutorial article about Expat [<a href="#Expat-tutorial">Expat-tutorial</a>]
explains well how Expat is supposed to be used. A user application
most certainly has to have</p>
<blockquote>a good stack mechanism in order to keep track of current
context... The things you're likely to want to keep on a stack are the
currently opened element and it's attributes. You push this
information onto the stack in the start handler and you pop it off in
the end handler.</blockquote>
<p>Compare that description with the following SSAX application, which
converts an XML document to a simplified (for the sake of clarity) SXML:</p>
<pre>     (define (simple-XML-&gt;SXML port)
       (reverse
        ((SSAX:make-parser
          NEW-LEVEL-SEED
          (lambda (elem-gi attributes namespaces expected-content seed)
          '())
     
          FINISH-ELEMENT
          (lambda (elem-gi attributes namespaces parent-seed seed)
            (cons (cons elem-gi (reverse seed)) parent-seed))
     
          CHAR-DATA-HANDLER
          (lambda (string1 string2 seed)
            (if (string-null? string2) (cons string1 seed)
                (cons* string2 string1 seed)))
     
         )
         port '())))
</pre>As you see, <code>simple-XML-&gt;SXML</code>
 does not need any stack
to keep track of the current context. There is no need to maintain the
stack across several callbacks and check for underflows and other
errors. The SSAX callbacks hardly do anything at all.  The simpler the
handlers are, the easier it is to write them and to reason about
them. <br>&nbsp;<a name="Answers to comments">&nbsp;</a>
<h2>Answers to comments</h2>
<br>&nbsp;<a name="Choice of XML trees as input files for the benchmark">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>Choice of XML trees as input files for the benchmark</h3>
<p>XML representation of trees has many deeply-<em>nested</em>
 <em>elements.</em>
Processing such documents exercises the parser
engine. In contrast, marked-up Shakespeare's plays (another popular
choice for benchmark input files) are comprised mostly of character
data. They do not exert the element parsing engine.</p>
<br>&nbsp;<a name="Is the benchmark fair to Expat?">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>Is the benchmark fair to Expat?</h3>
<blockquote><em>The most striking result is that a Scheme application is only 1.4
times slower than a comparable well-written C application.</em>
<br>
Yes, but only if you slow down the C application by a factor of 7 first.</blockquote>
SSAX could have read the whole document into memory and parse it from
there, as HaXml does. As the benchmark shows, parsing from memory and
avoiding any string copies increases the performance by a factor of
7. Yet I did not feel that solution satisfactory. I do parse XML
documents from pipes; oftentimes the documents are generated on the
fly so I do not know what the final size of the document will be. In
that situation, I can not load the document into memory without
&quot;pre-parsing&quot; of the input stream first. Furthermore, SSAX can handle
documents that are simply too big to load into memory.<br>&nbsp;<a name="Is SSAX really referentially transparent?">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>Is SSAX really referentially transparent?</h3>
<p>It is emphasized in SSAX title comments and elsewhere that the
input port is treated as a linear, read-once parameter. This technique
is similar to that of Clean. I/O in Clean <em>is</em>
 referentially
transparent.</p>
<p>Because the port is treated in SSAX as a read-once parameter,</p>
<pre>     (let ((result (foo port))) ...)
</pre>is equivalent to<pre>     (let-values (((result new-port) (foo* port))) ... )
</pre>and can be <em>mechanically</em>
 transformed into the latter if
needed. Transformations of that kind cannot generally be performed on
code that uses assignments indiscriminately (which is not
referentially transparent, that is).<p>In short, SSAX is as referentially transparent as Clean is --
which has been proven to be.</p>
<br>&nbsp;<a name="What">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>What about performance of Expat if it were to wrapped
in Scheme?</h3>
<blockquote>Just for the sake of argument, if one were to wrap Expat into
Scheme primitive objects, and invoke Expat from an interpreter, how do
you think it will perform?</blockquote>
<p>If you invoke Expat from a Scheme interpreter, you
should expect the the performance similar to that of Perl or Python
wrappers around Expat [<a href="#Parser-benchmark">Parser-benchmark</a>].</p>
<p>The wrappers start off well for small documents; but as the document
size increases to around 3 MB, the wrapped Expat becomes 20-30 times
slower than the original Expat. The reason is the cost of invoking of
Perl/Python callbacks from the Expat code (and the related cost of
translating strings and other data across the language barrier).</p>
