\begin{abstract}
The present article specifies revision 2.5 of SXML. SXML is an abstract syntax tree of an XML document. SXML is also
a concrete representation of the XML Infoset in the form of
S-expressions. The generic tree structure of SXML lends itself to a
compact library of combinators for querying and transforming SXML.\\The master SXML specification file is written in SXML itself. The present paper is the result of translating that SXML code into \LaTeX, using an appropriate "stylesheet". A different stylesheet converted the specification to HTML. The master file, the stylesheets and the corresponding HTML and \LaTeX documents are available at  \texttt{http://pobox.com/\textasciitilde{}oleg/ftp/Scheme/xml.html} .\\Keywords: XML, XML parsing, XML Infoset, XML Namespaces, AST, SXML, Scheme.\end{abstract}
\section{Introduction}
An XML document is essentially a tree structure. The start and the end
tags of the root element enclose the whole content of the document,
which may include other elements or arbitrary character data.  Text
with familiar angular brackets is an external representation of an XML
document. Applications ought to deal with an internalized form:
an XML Information Set, or its specializations.  This form lets an
application locate specific data or transform an XML tree into another
tree, which can then be written out as an XML, HTML, PDF, etc.
document.

XML Information Set (Infoset) \cite{XML Infoset} is an
abstract datatype that describes information available in a
well-formed XML document.  Infoset is made of "information items",
which denote elements, attributes, character data, processing
instructions, and other components of the document. Each information
item has a number of associated properties, e.g., name, namespace
URI. Some properties -- for example, 'children' and 'attributes' --
are collections of other information items. Infoset describes
only the information in an XML document that is relevant to
applications. The default value of attributes declared in the DTD, parameter
entities, the order of attributes within a start-tag, and other data used merely for parsing or validation are not included. Although technically 
Infoset is specified for XML it largely applies to other semi-structured data formats, in particular, HTML.

The hierarchy of containers comprised of text strings and other
containers greatly lends itself to be described by
S-expressions. S-expressions \cite{McCarthy} are easy to parse into an internal
representation suitable for traversal.  They have a simple external
notation (albeit with many a parentheses), which is relatively easy to
compose even by hand.  S-expressions have another advantage: \emph{provided} an appropriate design, they can represent Scheme code to be evaluated.
 This code-data dualism is a distinguished feature of Lisp and Scheme. 

SXML is a concrete instance of the XML Infoset. Infoset's goal is
to present in some form all relevant pieces of data and their \emph{abstract}, container-slot relationships with each other.  SXML
gives the nest of containers a concrete realization as S-expressions,
and provides means of accessing items and their properties. SXML is a
"relative" of XPath \cite{XPath} and DOM \cite{DOM},
whose data models are two other instances of the XML Infoset. SXML is
particularly suitable for Scheme-based XML/HTML authoring, SXPath
queries, and tree transformations. In John Hughes' terminology \cite{Hughes-PP}, SXML is a term implementation of evaluation of the XML
document.

\section{Notation}
We will use an Extended BNF Notation (EBNF) employed in the XML
Recommendation \cite{XML}. The following table summarizes the notation.

\begin{description}
\item [\texttt{thing?}] An optional \emph{thing}
\item [\texttt{thing*}] Zero or more \emph{thing}s
\item [\texttt{thing+}] One or more \emph{thing}s
\item [\texttt{thing1 | thing2 | thing3}] Choice of \emph{thing}s
\item [\texttt{<thing>}] A non-terminal of a grammar
\item [\texttt{thing}] A terminal of the grammar that is a Scheme identifier
\item [\texttt{"thing"}] A terminal of the grammar that is a Scheme string
\item [\texttt{{\itshape thing}}] A literal Scheme symbol
\item [\texttt{\textbf{(} <A> <B>* \textbf{)}}] An S-expression made of \texttt{<A>} followed by zero or more \texttt{<B>}
\item [\texttt{\textbf{(} <A>\textbf{ . }<B> \textbf{)}}] An S-expression that is made by prepending \texttt{<A>} to an S-expression denoted by \texttt{<B>}
\item [\texttt{\textbf{$MAKE-SYMBOL$(}<A>:<B>\textbf{)}}] A symbol whose string representation consists of all
characters that spell \texttt{<A>} followed by the colon character and by the characters that spell \texttt{<B>}. The \texttt{\textbf{$MAKE-SYMBOL$(}\textbf{)}} notation can be regarded a meta-function that creates symbols.
\end{description}
\section{Grammar}
\begin{tabular}{rrcp{2.8in}}
{[}1{]} & \texttt{<TOP>} &  $::=$ & \texttt{\textbf{(} {\itshape *TOP*} <aux-list>? <PI>* <comment>* <Element> \textbf{)} } \\
\end{tabular}
\\
This S-expression stands for the root of the SXML tree, a
document information item of the Infoset. Its only child element is
the root element of the XML document.

\begin{tabular}{rrcp{2.8in}}
{[}2{]} & \texttt{<Element>} &  $::=$ & \texttt{\textbf{(} <name> <attributes-list>? <aux-list>? <child-of-element>* \textbf{)} } \\
{[}3{]} & \texttt{<attributes-list>} &  $::=$ & \texttt{\textbf{(} {\itshape @} <attribute>* \textbf{)} } \\
{[}4{]} & \texttt{<attribute>} &  $::=$ & \texttt{\textbf{(} <name> "value"? <aux-list>? \textbf{)} } \\
{[}5{]} & \texttt{<child-of-element>} &  $::=$ & \texttt{<Element> | "character data" | <PI> | <comment> | <entity> } \\
\end{tabular}
\\
These are the basic constructs of SXML.

\begin{tabular}{rrcp{2.8in}}
{[}6{]} & \texttt{<PI>} &  $::=$ & \texttt{\textbf{(} {\itshape *PI*} pi-target "processing instruction content string" \textbf{)} } \\
\end{tabular}
\\
The XML Recommendation specifies that processing instructions (PI) are distinct from elements and character data; processing
instructions must be passed through to applications. In SXML, PIs are
therefore represented by nodes of a dedicated type \texttt{*PI*}. DOM Level 2 treats processing instructions in a similar way.

\begin{tabular}{rrcp{2.8in}}
{[}7{]} & \texttt{<comment>} &  $::=$ & \texttt{\textbf{(} {\itshape *COMMENT*} "comment string" \textbf{)} } \\
{[}8{]} & \texttt{<entity>} &  $::=$ & \texttt{\textbf{(} {\itshape *ENTITY*} "public-id" "system-id" \textbf{)} } \\
\end{tabular}
\\
Comments are mentioned for completeness. A SSAX XML parser
\cite{SSAX}, among others, transparently skips the comments.
The XML Recommendation permits the parser to pass the comments to
an application or to completely disregard them. The present SXML grammar
admits comment nodes but does not mandate them by any means.\\ An \texttt{<entity>} node represents a reference to an
unexpanded external entity. This node corresponds to an unexpanded
entity reference information item, defined in Section 2.5 of \cite{XML Infoset}. Internal parsed entities are always expanded by the
XML processor at the point of their reference in the body of the
document.

\begin{tabular}{rrcp{2.8in}}
{[}9{]} & \texttt{<name>} &  $::=$ & \texttt{<LocalName> | <ExpName> } \\
{[}10{]} & \texttt{<LocalName>} &  $::=$ & \texttt{NCName } \\
{[}11{]} & \texttt{<ExpName>} &  $::=$ & \texttt{\textbf{$MAKE-SYMBOL$(}<namespace-id>:<LocalName>\textbf{)} } \\
{[}12{]} & \texttt{<namespace-id>} &  $::=$ & \texttt{\textbf{$MAKE-SYMBOL$(}"URI"\textbf{)} | user-ns-shortcut } \\
{[}13{]} & \texttt{<namespaces>} &  $::=$ & \texttt{\textbf{(} {\itshape *NAMESPACES*} <namespace-assoc>* \textbf{)} } \\
{[}14{]} & \texttt{<namespace-assoc>} &  $::=$ & \texttt{\textbf{(} <namespace-id> "URI" {\itshape original-prefix}? \textbf{)} } \\
\end{tabular}
\\
An SXML \texttt{<name>} is a single symbol. It is generally an expanded name \cite{XML-Namespaces}, which conceptually consists of a
local name and a namespace URI. The latter part may be empty, in which
case
\texttt{<name>} is a \texttt{NCName}: a Scheme
symbol whose spelling conforms to production [4] of the XML Namespaces
Recommendation \cite{XML-Namespaces}. \texttt{<ExpName>} is also a Scheme symbol, whose string representation
contains an embedded colon that joins the local and the namespace
parts of the name. A \texttt{\textbf{$MAKE-SYMBOL$(}"URI"\textbf{)}} is a Namespace URI
string converted to a Scheme symbol. Universal Resource Identifiers (URI)
may contain characters (e.g., parentheses) that are prohibited
in Scheme identifiers. Such characters must be \%-quoted during the
conversion from a URI string to \texttt{<namespace-id>}. The original XML Namespace prefix of a QName \cite{XML-Namespaces} 
may be retained as an optional member \texttt{{\itshape original-prefix}} of a \texttt{<namespace-assoc>}
association. A \texttt{user-ns-shortcut} is a Scheme
symbol chosen by an application programmer to represent a namespace
URI in the application program. The SSAX parser lets the programmer
define (short and mnemonic) unique shortcuts for Namespace URIs,
which are are often long and unwieldy strings.

\begin{tabular}{rrcp{2.8in}}
{[}15{]} & \texttt{<aux-list>} &  $::=$ & \texttt{\textbf{(} {\itshape @@} <namespaces>? <aux-node>* \textbf{)} } \\
{[}16{]} & \texttt{<aux-node>} &  $::=$ & \texttt{~ } \emph{To be defined in the future}\\
\end{tabular}
\\
The XML Recommendation and related standards are not firmly
fixed, as the long list of errata and the proposed version 1.1 of XML
clearly show. Therefore, SXML has to be able to accommodate future
changes while guaranteeing backwards compatibility. SXML also ought to
permit applications to store various processing information (e.g.,
cached resolved IDREFs) in an SXML tree. A hash of ID-type attributes
would, for instance, let us implement efficient lookups in (SOAP-)
encoded arrays. To allow such extensibility, we introduce two new node
types, \texttt{<aux-list>} and \texttt{<aux-node>}. The semantics of
the latter is to be established in future versions of SXML. Other
candidates for \texttt{<aux-node>} are the unique id of an
element or the reference to element's parent. The structure and the
semantics of an \texttt{<aux-list>} node is similar to those of an attribute list. Applications that do not specifically look for auxiliary
nodes can transparently ignore any present and future extensions.

\section{SXML Tree}
Infoset's information item is a sum of its properties. This makes
a list a particularly suitable data structure to represent an
item. The head of the list, a Scheme identifier, \emph{names} the
item. For many items this is their (expanded) name. For an information
item that denotes an XML element, the corresponding list starts with
element's expanded name, optionally followed by collections of
attributes and of auxiliary data. The rest of the element item list
is an ordered sequence of element's children -- character data,
processing instructions, and other elements. Every child is unique;
items never share their children even if the latter have the identical
content.

Just as XPath does and the Infoset specification explicitly allows,
we group character information items into maximal text strings.  The
value of an attribute is normally a string; it may be omitted (in
case of HTML) for a boolean attribute, e.g., \texttt{<option checked>}.

We consider a collection of attributes an information item in its
own right, tagged with a special name \texttt{@}. The character '@'
may not occur in a valid XML name; therefore
an \texttt{<attributes-list>} cannot be mistaken for a list that represents an element. An XML
document renders attributes, processing instructions, namespace
specifications and other meta-data differently from the element
markup. In contrast, SXML represents element content and meta-data
uniformly -- as tagged lists. RELAX-NG also aims to treat attributes
as uniformly as possible with elements. This uniform treatment, argues James
Clark \cite{RNG-Design}, is a significant factor
in simplifying the language.  SXML takes advantage of the fact that
every XML name is also a valid Scheme identifier, but not every
Scheme identifier is a valid XML name. This observation lets us
introduce administrative names such as \texttt{@}, \texttt{*PI*}, \texttt{*NAMESPACES*} without worrying about potential name
clashes. The observation also makes the relationship between XML and SXML
well-defined. An XML document converted to SXML can be reconstructed
into an equivalent (in terms of the Infoset) XML document. Moreover, due
to the implementation freedom given by the Infoset specification, SXML
itself is an instance of the Infoset.

Since an SXML document is essentially a tree structure, the SXML grammar of Section 3 can be presented in the following, more uniform form:

\begin{tabular}{rrcp{2.8in}}
{[}N{]} & \texttt{<Node>} &  $::=$ & \texttt{<Element> | <attributes-list> | <attribute> | "character data: text string" | <namespaces> | <TOP> | <PI> | <comment> | <entity> | <aux-list> | <aux-node> } \\
\end{tabular}
\\
or as a set of two mutually-recursive datatypes, 
\texttt{Node} and \texttt{Nodelist}, where the latter is a list of \texttt{Node}s: 

\begin{tabular}{rrcp{2.8in}}
{[}N1{]} & \texttt{<Node>} &  $::=$ & \texttt{\textbf{(} <name>\textbf{ . }<Nodelist> \textbf{)} | "text string" } \\
{[}N2{]} & \texttt{<Nodelist>} &  $::=$ & \texttt{\textbf{(} <Node> <Node>* \textbf{)} } \\
{[}N3{]} & \texttt{<name>} &  $::=$ & \texttt{<LocalName> | <ExpName> | {\itshape @} | {\itshape *TOP*} | {\itshape *PI*} | {\itshape *COMMENT*} | {\itshape *ENTITY*} | {\itshape *NAMESPACES*} | {\itshape @@} } \\
\end{tabular}
\\
The uniformity of the SXML representation for elements,
attributes, and processing instructions simplifies queries and
transformations. In our formulation, attributes and processing
instructions look like regular elements with a distinguished
name. Therefore, query and transformation functions dedicated to
attributes become redundant.

A function \texttt{SSAX:XML->SXML} of a functional Scheme XML parsing
framework SSAX \cite{SSAX} can convert an XML document or a
well-formed part of it into the corresponding SXML form. The parser
supports namespaces, character and parsed entities, 
attribute value normalization, processing instructions and CDATA
sections.

\section{Namespaces}
The motivation for XML Namespaces is explained in an excellent article by James Clark \cite{Clark1999}. He says in part: 

\begin{quote}
The XML Namespaces Recommendation tries to improve this
situation by extending the data model to allow element type names and
attribute names to be qualified with a URI. Thus a document that
describes parts of cars can use \texttt{part} qualified by one URI; and a
document that describes parts of books can use \texttt{part} qualified by
another URI. I'll call the combination of a local name and a
qualifying URI a universal name. The role of the URI in a universal
name is purely to allow applications to recognize the name. There are
no guarantees about the resource identified by the URI. The XML
Namespaces Recommendation does not require element type names and
attribute names to be universal names; they are also allowed to be
local names.\\ ...\\ The XML Namespaces Recommendation expresses universal names in an
indirect way that is compatible with XML 1.0. In effect the XML
Namespaces Recommendation defines a mapping from an XML 1.0 tree where
element type names and attribute names are local names into a tree
where element type names and attribute names can be universal
names. The mapping is based on the idea of a prefix. If an element
type name or attribute name contains a colon, then the mapping treats
the part of the name before the colon as a prefix, and the part of the
name after the colon as the local name. A prefix \texttt{foo}
refers to the URI specified in the value of the \texttt{xmlns:foo}
attribute. So, for example\begin{verbatim}
     <cars:part xmlns:cars='http://www.cars.com/xml'/>
\end{verbatim}
maps to\begin{verbatim}
     <{http://www.cars.com/xml}part/>
\end{verbatim}
Note that the \texttt{xmlns:cars} attribute has been removed by the mapping.\end{quote}
Using James Clark's terminology, SXML as defined by [N1] is
precisely that tree where element type names and attribute names can
be universal names.  According to productions [N3] and [9-12], a
universal name, \texttt{<name>}, is either a local name or an expanded
name. Both kinds of names are Scheme identifiers. A local name has no
colon characters in its spelling. An expanded name is spelled with at
least one colon, which may make the identifier look rather odd. In
SXML, James Clark's example will appear as follows:\begin{verbatim}
     (http://www.cars.com/xml:part)
\end{verbatim}
or, somewhat redundantly, \begin{verbatim}
     (http://www.cars.com/xml:part (@)
        (@@ (*NAMESPACES* (cars "http://www.cars.com/xml"))))
\end{verbatim}


Such a representation also agrees with the Namespaces Recommendation \cite{XML-Namespaces}, which says: "Note that the prefix
functions only as a placeholder for a namespace name. Applications
should use the namespace name, not the prefix, in constructing names
whose scope extends beyond the containing document."

It may be unwieldy to deal with identifiers such as \texttt{http://www.cars.com/xml:part}. Therefore, an application that
invokes the SSAX parser may tell the parser to map the URI \texttt{http://www.cars.com/xml} to an application-specific namespace shortcut \texttt{user-ns-shortcut}, e.g., \texttt{c}. The parser will then produce\begin{verbatim}
     (c:part (@@ (*NAMESPACES* (c "http://www.cars.com/xml"))))
\end{verbatim}
To be more precise, the parser will return just\begin{verbatim}
     (c:part)
\end{verbatim}
If an application told the parser how to map \texttt{http://www.cars.com/xml}, the application can keep this mapping in
its mind and will not need additional reminders.On the other hand, we should not be afraid of SXML node
names such as \texttt{http://www.cars.com/xml:part}. These names
are Scheme symbols. No matter how long the name of a symbol may be, it
is fully spelled only once, in the symbol table. All other occurrences
of the symbol are short references to the corresponding slot in
the symbol table.



We must note there is a 1-to-1 correspondence between \texttt{user-ns-shortcut}s and the corresponding namespace URIs. This is generally not true
for XML namespace prefixes and namespace URIs. A \texttt{user-ns-shortcut} uniquely represents the corresponding namespace
URI within the document, but an XML namespace prefix does not. For
example, different XML prefixes may specify the same namespace
URI; XML namespace prefixes may be redefined in children elements. The
other difference between \texttt{user-ns-shortcut}s and
XML namespace prefixes is that the latter are at the whims of the author
of the document whereas the namespace shortcuts are defined by an
XML processing application. The shortcuts are syntactic sugar for namespace URIs.

The list of associations between namespace IDs and namespace URIs (and, optionally, original XML Namespace prefixes) is an optional member of an \texttt{<aux-list>}. For regular elements, \texttt{<namespaces>} will contain only those namespace declarations that are relevant for that element. Most of the time however \texttt{<namespaces>} in the \texttt{<aux-list>} will be absent.

The node \texttt{<namespaces>}, if present in the auxiliary list of the \texttt{<TOP>} element, must contain \texttt{<namespace-assoc>} for the whole document. It may happen that one
namespace URI is associated in the source XML document with several
namespace prefixes. There will be then several corresponding \texttt{<namespace-assoc>} differing only in the \texttt{{\itshape original-prefix}} part.

The topic of namespaces in SXML and (S)XPath is discussed in
more detail in \cite{SXML-NS}.

\section{Case-sensitivity of SXML names}
XML is a case-sensitive language. The names of XML elements,
attributes, targets of processing instructions, etc. may be
distinguished solely by their case. These names however are
represented as Scheme identifiers in SXML. Although Scheme is
traditionally a case-insensitive language, the use of Scheme symbols
for XML names poses no contradictions. According to R5RS \cite{R5RS}, \begin{quote}
(symbol->string symbol) returns the name of symbol as a string. If
the symbol was part of an object returned as the value of a literal
expression (section 4.1.2) or by a call to the read procedure, and its
name contains alphabetic characters, then the string returned will
contain characters in the implementation's preferred standard
case -- some implementations will prefer upper case, others lower
case. If the symbol was returned by string->symbol, the case of
characters in the string returned will be the same as the case in the
string that was passed to string->symbol.\end{quote}


Thus, R5RS explicitly permits case-sensitive symbols: \texttt{(string->symbol "a")} is always different from \texttt{(string->symbol "A")}. SXML uses such case-sensitive symbols for
all XML names. SXML-compliant XML parsers must preserve the case of
all names when converting them into symbols. A parser may use the R5RS
procedure \texttt{string->symbol} or other available means.

Reading and writing SXML documents may require special care. The cited R5RS section allows a Scheme system to alter the case of symbols found in a literal expression or read from input ports. Entering SXML names on case-insensitive systems requires the use of a bar notation, \texttt{string->symbol} or
other standard or non-standard ways of producing case-sensitive
symbols. A SSAX built-in test suite is a highly portable example of entering literal case-sensitive SXML names. Such workarounds, however simple, become unnecessary on Scheme systems that support DSSSL. According to the DSSSL standard,\begin{quote}
7.3.1. Case Sensitivity. Upper- and lower-case forms of a
letter are always distinguished. NOTE 5: Traditionally Lisp systems
are case-insensitive.\end{quote}
In addition, a great number of Scheme systems offer a
case-sensitive reader, which often has to be activated through a
compiler option or pragma. A web page \cite{Scheme-case-sensitivity} discusses case sensitivity of various Scheme systems in detail.

\section{Normalized SXML}
Normalized SXML is a proper subset of SXML optimized for
efficient processing. An SXML document in a normalized form must
satisfy a number of additional restrictions. Most of the restrictions
concern the order and the appearance of the \texttt{<attributes-list>} and \texttt{<aux-list>} within an
\texttt{<Element>} node, production [2]. In the spirit of the relational database
model, we introduce a number of increasingly rigorous normal forms for
SXML expressions. An SXML document in normal form N is also in normal
form M for any M<N. The higher normal forms impose more constraints on
the structure of SXML expressions but in return permit faster access.

The most permissive 0NF does not mandate the presence or the relative
order of \texttt{<attributes-list>} and \texttt{<aux-list>}. These lists, if present, may be inter-mixed
with \texttt{<child-of-element>}. SGML provides two equal forms for
boolean attributes: minimized, e.g., \texttt{<OPTION checked>} and
full, \texttt{<OPTION checked="checked">}. XML mandates the full
form only, whereas HTML allows both, favoring the former. 0NF SXML
supports the minimized form along with the full one: \texttt{(OPTION (@ (checked)))} and \texttt{(OPTION (@ (checked "checked")))}.

In the 1NF, an optional \texttt{<attributes-list>} must
precede an optional \texttt{<aux-list>} in an \texttt{<Element>} SXML node. This is the order
reflected in Production [2].  In addition, if \texttt{<aux-list>} is present, then
\texttt{<attributes-list>} must also be specified, at least as
an empty attribute list \texttt{(@)}. This restriction ensures
that \texttt{<aux-list>}, if present, is always the third
element of a list representing the SXML node. Boolean attributes must
appear in their full form, e.g., \texttt{(OPTION (@ (checked "checked")))}. The 1NF is the "recommended" normal form.

The 2NF makes \texttt{<attributes-list>} a required component of an SXML element node. If an element has no attributes, \texttt{<attributes-list>} shall be specified as \texttt{(@)}. An optional \texttt{<aux-list>}, if present, must immediately follow. In the 2NF,
\texttt{<comment>} and \texttt{<entity>} nodes
must be absent. Parsed entities should be expanded, even
if they are external.

The third normal form 3NF makes \texttt{<aux-list>}
mandatory as well. This list is always the third member of an SXML
element node, after \texttt{<name>} and \texttt{<attributes-list>}. If an element node has
no associated auxiliary information, the \texttt{<aux-list>} must
be specified as \texttt{(@@)}. In addition, all text strings must be
joined into maximal text strings: no \texttt{<Nodelist>} shall
contain two adjacent text-string nodes.

The normal forms make it possible to access SXML items in
efficient ways. If an SXML document is known to be in the 3NF, for
example, an application never has to check for the existence of
 \texttt{<attributes-list>} or \texttt{<aux-list>}. Checking for child nodes and retrieving text data are simplified as well.

\section{Examples}
Simple examples:\begin{verbatim}
     (some-name)        ; An empty element without attributes (in 0NF and 1NF)
     (some-name (@))    ; The same but in the normalized (2NF) form
\end{verbatim}
